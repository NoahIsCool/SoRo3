these are the projects to test a udp connection.
run the "rover" executable before the "mc" one.
The two programs should send one message back and forth. (the ip is currently set to localhost, should be easy to change)
If it says there's an error binding to the port, make sure to change the port that didn't work in BOTH programs (the two projects are nearly identical)
