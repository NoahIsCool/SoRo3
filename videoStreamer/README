This is a super simplfied version the the old rover streamig video code. The best part
of this code is the fact that it can stream up to 3 videos at the same time.
The down side is that I have no idea how in the fuck to make a gui...soooo it uses mpv 
instead...you can use vlc if you want, but I'm not going to put it into the code.
to use vlc use this: 

Anyways, to use this code, put the videoStreamer on the rover along with the config folder.
The code will expect the config folder to be under here: /opt/videoStreamer
if its not, simply give it the location of the config file: ./videoStreamer /dir/to/config

Finally, until further notice, use the script ./startVideos, I'm still working on the 
code that will do what that script does. But once the code for the videoDisplayer is done
the script will no longer work because the rover will expect a 'heartbeat' to ensure its
not waisting broadband.

You should use the: SCRIPT
