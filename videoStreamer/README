This is a super simplfied version the the old rover streamig video code. The best part
of this code is the fact that it can stream up to 3 videos at the same time.
The down side is that I have no idea how in the fuck to make a gui...soooo it uses gstreamer in the terminal to create a window.

That being said...This code is kinda hacky right now...I really just wanted to put
something out there that works. I will clean it up later but for now it sucks.

Anyways, to use this code, put the videoStreamer on the rover along with the config folder.
The code will expect the config folder to be under here: /home/soro/videoStreamer
this is for both the rover and the mission control

One of the things Im still working on, is if you close the videoDisplayer on the mission
control side, it crashes the videoStreamer on the rover side. It has something to do with 
the connect function. Im still working on it...

to use the code:
1)
lauch both the videoStreamer on the rover and the videoDisplayer on the mission control.
The order doesnt matter

2)
start the video stream using a command like this:

start front
start back
start claw

these are entered into the videoDisplayer terminal
sometimes, it takes a little for the video window to pop up so give it a little time.

To close it, sorry, its still a little hacky... you have to close the window and type

stop front

or which camera you were using to stop the stream and close the window.
Sorry, Ill figure out how to fix it soon.
