This is a super simplfied version the the old rover streamig video code. The best part
of this code is the fact that it can stream up to 3 videos at the same time.
The down side is that I have no idea how in the fuck to make a gui...soooo it uses gstreamers autosink to show the stream.

That being said...This code is kinda hacky right now...I really just wanted to put
something out there that works. I will clean it up later but for now it sucks.

Anyways, to use this code, put the videoStreamer on the rover along with the config folder.
The code will expect the config folder to be under here: /home/soro/videoStreamer
this is for both the rover and the mission control

Right now, it only supports 1 client. Eventually, I will fix it so 2 clients can connect
by forwarding streams from the first client to the second. You know, to save on broadband
between us and the rover.

to use the code:
1)
lauch both the videoStreamer on the rover and the videoDisplayer on the mission control.
The order doesnt matter

2)
start the video stream using a command like this:

start front
start back
start claw

these are entered into the videoDisplayer terminal
sometimes, it takes a little for the video window to pop up so give it a little time.

best way to close it would be to type stop front or which ever stream you were using,
because then it will tell the server to kill the stream. Ill fix that later where it 
wont matter but for now typing is better.
