This is a super simplfied version the the old rover streamig video code. The best part
of this code is the fact that it can stream up to 3 videos at the same time.
The down side is that I have no idea how in the fuck to make a gui...soooo it uses gstreamers autosink to show the stream.

Anyways, to use this code, put the videoStreamer on the rover along with the config folder.
The code will expect the config folder to be under here: /home/soro/videoStreamer
this is for both the rover and the mission control

This code should support as many client as cameras you have...So have fun.

To build:
check out the BUILD file

If any of the build fails, try to make sure that qt5 is installed and qt5gstreamer.
those are the only other dependencies you need for this project.
If you are compiling the videoDisplayer, just open it on qt creator. Its soo much easier.
videoDisplayer also needs the Networking project so open that in qt creator first and build it.

to use the code:
1) running is a little difficult because I wanted to make coding easier. Sorry.
Anyways, if you run it in qt creator then it should handle everything. If you are running
it in the terminal then you either have to run one of my scripts or run this command before
launching either the videoStreamer or videoDisplayer.

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/soro/videoStreamer/Networking

This tells the system where the networking library is.

Then, launch the videoStreamer on the rover and the videoDisplayer on the mission control.
The order doesnt matter

2)
start the video stream using a command like this:

start front
start back
start claw

these are entered into the videoDisplayer terminal
sometimes, it takes a little for the video window to pop up so give it a little time.

best way to close it would be to type stop front or which ever stream you were using,
because then it will tell the server to kill the stream. Ill fix that later where it 
wont matter but for now typing is better.
