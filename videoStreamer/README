This is a super simplfied version the the old rover streamig video code. The best part
of this code is the fact that it can stream up to 3 videos at the same time.
The down side is that I have no idea how in the fuck to make a gui...soooo it uses gstreamers autosink to show the stream.

That being said...This code is kinda hacky right now...I really just wanted to put
something out there that works. I will clean it up later but for now it sucks.

Anyways, to use this code, put the videoStreamer on the rover along with the config folder.
The code will expect the config folder to be under here: /home/soro/videoStreamer
this is for both the rover and the mission control

Right now, it only supports 1 client. Eventually, I will fix it so 2 clients can connect
by forwarding streams from the first client to the second. You know, to save on broadband
between us and the rover.

To build:
go to the scripts folder and run ./build
it should handle everything for you but if it doesnt, this is what you need to do
first make sure qt5 is installed on the up board.
then cd into the networking folder. We want to build this first.
run 'qmake Networking.pro -r -spec linux-g++' to generate the make file
then run 'make' to compile it
and finally run 'sudo make install' to install it.

Next, to build the videoStreamer.
cd into the videoDisplayer folder.
run 'qmake videoDisplayer.pro -r -spec linux-g++' to generate the makefile for it
the run 'make'
and it should be good to go.

If any of this fails, try to make sure that qt5 is installed and qt5gstreamer.
those are the only other dependencies you need for this project.
If you are compiling the videoDisplayer, just open it on qt creator. Its soo much easier.
videoDisplayer also needs the Networking project so open that in qt creator first and build it.

to use the code:
1)
lauch both the videoStreamer on the rover and the videoDisplayer on the mission control.
The order doesnt matter

2)
start the video stream using a command like this:

start front
start back
start claw

these are entered into the videoDisplayer terminal
sometimes, it takes a little for the video window to pop up so give it a little time.

best way to close it would be to type stop front or which ever stream you were using,
because then it will tell the server to kill the stream. Ill fix that later where it 
wont matter but for now typing is better.
