So here are some arduino files to get us started with testing the robotic arm.

The first 2, stepperServo and continuousServo, I wrote at 11pm on a pants friday night right after I broke my servos soo...props not going to work because I couldnt really test it...
Feel free to add more test files, edit test files or use the test files. They are here to help teach eachother how these work and unit test everything.
