# SoRo3
Sooner Rover Team, 2017-2018

If you want to check out some of the old code here are the links to the github pages.
https://github.com/doublejinitials/soro

https://github.com/doublejinitials/soro2_drive_arduino
https://github.com/doublejinitials/soro-mbed
https://github.com/cotrone/rover 

The soro-mbed has the code for the robotic arm master and slave systems.
Soro2 has the server code for everything and the soro-core has lots of stuff but the one thing I noticed it has is the "network objects" or the objects that is passed between devices.
